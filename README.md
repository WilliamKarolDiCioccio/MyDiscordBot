# MyDiscordBot

## Description

MyDiscordBot is a TypeScript-based Discord bot project designed for lighthearted enjoyment on your Discord server. It's not about reinventing the wheel, but rather about adding a touch of whimsy and coolness to your server interactions.

## Purpose

The purpose of MyDiscordBot is simple: to bring joy and coolness to your Discord server. It's not meant to be the most groundbreaking bot out there, but rather a fun integration that adds something extra to your server experience.

## Roadmap

Our roadmap is simple and laid back:

1. **Fun AI Stuff**: Add more cool AI integrations? Let's make the bot even cooler!
2. **Customization Galore**: Give users more ways to customize the bot's antics and make it truly their own.
3. **Chill Community Vibes**: Foster a chill and fun community around the bot where everyone can share their coolest ideas and creations.
4. **GitHub Playground**: Share the bot's code on GitHub, not because we're trying to change the world, but just in case someone else thinks it's as cool as we do!
